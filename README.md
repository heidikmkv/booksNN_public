This repository contains key scripts used to analyze the seasonality of textbook prices on Amazon.com, aimed at optimizing textbook arbitrage. The prices of commonly used college textbooks typically follow the academic semester cycle, with high prices and low inventory at the start of the semester, and lower prices with abundant inventory toward the end. The scripts in this repo were developed to track these fluctuations, helping identify the best times to buy and sell textbooks for profit.

In this arbitrage process, I sourced textbooks from platforms like eBay, Abebooks, eCampus, and TextbookRush, and sold them as a third-party seller on Amazon using Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA). This allowed my inventory to be available for Amazon Prime shipping, boosting sales potential. The scripts here provide insight into the tools and methods I used to monitor prices, manage inventory, and execute successful textbook arbitrage.
